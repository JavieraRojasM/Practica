Three example recordings of the Aplysia pedal ganglion during fictive locomotion.

Each recording's data-file contains the array "spks" that codes the spike-times of all simultaneously recorded cells in that session. 

"spks" is arranged in [ID time] format (ID: neuron number; time: spike-time in seconds)

All recordings are 80 seconds long. 
T=0 seconds corresponds to 1 second post-offset of the nerve stimulation that induces fictive locomotion
